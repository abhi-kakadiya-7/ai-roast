      "Apple’s site is sleek, sure — but it’s also 90% whitespace and 10% product. Navigating it feels like walking into an art gallery where the art is hiding behind the walls. It’s so minimal it’s almost existential.",
    jokes: [
      "So much whitespace, I thought I was staring into the void.",
      "Navigation is a mystery — was this designed by a magician?",

      "Surface more content above the fold — not everyone scrolls.",
